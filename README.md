Download and Metadata Portal for the UNISDR-Data at https://gar.mnm-team.org

# Use Docker to build and run the portal

# Environment Variables

```
-e DIR='PATH_TO_DIRECTORY'

```

Use this variable with docker run to specify which directory in the container
should be mounted. Be aware that due to the initial caching of file structure
and sizes, the first startup may take a while.
